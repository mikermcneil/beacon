Beacon vs. Sails.js
===

This is a fresh Sails install, with a few extras:

- some useful packages are added in package.json
- Jam.js frontend dependency manager is added
- Jam and Require.js integrated into the site layout header
- Conditionizr.js added
- Snippets Manager has a working prototype in the /views folder
- Non-functional Beacon "containers" and code is mocked out in /beacon folder


Some Todos:
---

- integrate require.js compiling into process
- how to call snippets from any template?
- make google fonts working, and supporting array
- connect Knockout.js mapping plugin to the Sails websocket
- HTML minification?
- markdown view parser?
- frontend boilerplate code
- get require.js working with knockout (or bypass it)
- autoload css/js for snippets?
