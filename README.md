# Beacon
### a better blogging platform

*Under Construction*

Beacon is an idea for a streamlined CMS engine built on top of [Sails.js](http://sailsjs.org) and Node. It is modeled after WordPress, but without the bad parts - plus a bunch of extras thrown in.

So far this is just a conceptual mockup, please pardon our dust.

- Themes: the frontend of your blog or website
- Plugins: small add-ons that give extra functionality
- Apps: large add-ons that give your website super powers

The theme data model and theme structure would stay very similar to the WordPress, but better. Themes, plugins and apps could be installed via an easy-to-use "container" loader.
