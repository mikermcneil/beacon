- integrate require.js compiling into process
- finish view snippets, inspired by punch-thirdparty-snippets-helper
-- how to do global snippets?
-- how to pass variables into snippets?
-- make google fonts working, and supporting array
- connect Knockout.js mapping plugin to the Sails websocket
- HTML minification?
- markdown view parser?
- frontend boilerplate code
- optional js assets in footer?
