### a Sails.js application boilerplate

*Under Construction*

This is a fresh Sails install, with a few extras:

- some useful packages are added in package.json, including the Jam.js frontend dependency manager
- Jam and Require.js integrated into the site layout header
- Conditionizr.js added

Todos:

- get require.js working with knockout (or bypass it)
- integrate require.js compiling into process
- view helpers/snippets, inspired by punch-thirdparty-snippets-helper
- connect Knockout.js mapping plugin to the Sails websocket
- HTML minification?
- markdown view parser?
- frontend boilerplate code
- optional js assets in footer?
