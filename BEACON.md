# beacon
### a better blogging platform

*Under Construction*

Beacon is a streamlined CMS engine built on top of Sails.js and Node. It is modeled after WordPress, but without the bad parts - plus a bunch of extras thrown in.

So far this is just a conceptual mockup, please pardon our dust.

Stucture

Beacon is composed of 3 parts:

- Themes: the frontend of your blog or website
- Plugins: small add-ons that give extra functionality
- Apps: large add-ons that give your website super powers

Themes and plugins use a simple snippets manager to include frontend components.
